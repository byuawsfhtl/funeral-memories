      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to provide a place for families to share memories of 
        their loved ones. This website is intended to be used at funerals or memorials for a 
        deceased person.
      </p>
      <h2>Host</h2>
      <p> The admin will need to pull their family member's PID from family search...</p>
      <h2>Visitors</h2>
      <p> Visitors will need to enter the host's funeral access code to access the memory wall.
        This is where you can post about your loved one (photos, stories, etc.)
      </p>
      <h2>What happens with the memories of my loved one?</h2>
      <p> The memories will be stored in a database and will be available for viewing by anyone 
        who has the access code. One month after creation of the memories, 
        they will be uploaded to familysearch to be more permanently stored.
